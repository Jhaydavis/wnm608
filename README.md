## Car Enthusiast Art Repo

This project was developed by Jhay Davis during the Spring Semester at AAU as part of the PHP Backend development class.

The initial setup for this project involved developing the CSS styling, HTML, PHP Includes/Requires, and MySQL integration. NOTE: Actual payment processing will not be in scope for this project.
