				<h3>Performance Car Art</h3>

				<p>Car Enthusisast Art explores experience design, creative, and technical development of high performance sports cars from an artistic perspective. This includes art pieces developed in acrylic, oils, and water color as well as digital formats. </p>

				<p>Explore more technical details about the cars you love at our partner site, <a href="https://www.carperformancedata.com/">Car Performance Data</a>. This site not only highlights performance cars but also the science behind how they perform. More importantly, you’ll get insight into what it actually takes to accelerate to 60 mph in under 2 seconds. Ever wonder how much traction is needed to get that horsepower to the ground, how many G’s of acceleration you’ll experience pushing back in the seat when driving a 911 Turbo S, and how that feels compared to another super car? Each month, they show you.</p>
